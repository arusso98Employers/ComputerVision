# Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

This  course  offers  an  introduction  to computer vision  and computational photography.  The  course covers  basic  principles  of  image  processing, image  recognition using  both  classical  methods  and  deep  learning,  and multiple  view  geometry  for  visual navigation.  It explores the topics of image formation, image features, image stitching, image and video segmentation, motion estimation, tracking, and object and scene recognition.
